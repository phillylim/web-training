            I learned about the overall function of various languages 
            that are used in web development - including HTML, 
            CSS, and Javascript. HTML is like the skeleton of the
            web page, while CSS is like the skin, affecting 
            how the page is viewed and presented typically
            by linking it to the HTML file. On the other hand,
            Javascript is more like something used for retrieval from
            servers and involved more with the inner workings of the website's 
            function. I also learned about the stages of software development and that
            products typically go through these cycles multiple times before
            releasing a fully fledged product or website. These steps include
            requirement analysis, design, programming/creation, testing, and reassessment.

            <h2>My Favorite Movie</h2>
            <p>My favorite movie is The Room. Not because of the great acting or amazing plot, but because of the opposite: it absolutely sucks. It sucks so much that it's actually good. My favorite line from the movie is "Oh Hi Mark!"</p>
